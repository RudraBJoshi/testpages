/**
 * GameEnv manages the game environment.
 * 
 * The focus of the file is the canvas management and the calculation of the game area dimensions. 
 * All calculations are based on the window size, header, and footer.
 * 
 * This code uses an instance-based class pattern, which allows each GameLevel to have its own GameEnv.
 * 
 * The instance-based class pattern ensures that there can be multiple instances of the game environment,
 * providing a separate point of reference for each game level. This approach helps maintain
 * consistency and simplifies the management of shared resources like the canvas and its dimensions.
 * 
 * @class GameEnv
 * @property {Object} container - The DOM element that contains the game.
 * @property {Object} canvas - The canvas element.
 * @property {Object} ctx - The 2D rendering context of the canvas.
 * @property {number} innerWidth - The inner width of the game area.
 * @property {number} innerHeight - The inner height of the game area.
 * @property {number} top - The top offset of the game area.
 * @property {number} bottom - The bottom offset of the game area.
 * @property {string} canvasId - The unique ID of the canvas element for this instance.
